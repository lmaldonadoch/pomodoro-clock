# Pomodoro Clock

> This is a basic Pomodoro Clock with adjustable Session and Break settings.

This project was built with Vanilla Javascript, using Time Objects, defining and implementing functions, and interacting with DOM elements. It integrates buttons functionality to interact with the clock and change time settings.

## Usage example

A Pomodoro clock is extremely useful when working because it allows you to take breaks when needed. Studies have shown that humans can not stay focused for over 25 minutes, so this tool will help you stay aware of when it is time to take a short break.
